# eDNA study simulation

Richard A. Erickson, Christopher M. Merkes, and Erica L. Mize

This code supports USGS project IP-XXXXXX. Specifically, we used this code to examine different sampling methods for eDNA-based studies as well as the ability of a three-level occupancy model to recover parameters. The `sampleSize` file contains script files to examine necessary sample sizes to detect DNA assuming the speices is present at a site (i.e., \(\phi\)).  The `recoverModel` file contains
